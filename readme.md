# YAPG - Yet Another Password Generator

## A simple web password generator written in PHP to create secure passwords.

Live-Example here [YAPG](http://quellcode.ddns.net/yapg)[^1].

- You can choose between 4 and 32 characters and include numbers and special characters.
- It is ensured that there are no special characters at the beginning and at the end of a password.
- Furthermore, it is ensured that 0 and O may not be contained in a password at the same time in order to avoid misinterpretations.
- Once you have made a selection, you can always use these settings to generate a new password. Your selection will be restored after generation or displayed in the form.
- The generated passwords are never saved!
- As additional information, the generated password is also output in encrypted form
